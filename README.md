# TÃ©ka - WIP

Book cataloging system for personal libraries

Planned features for v1 release:
- user profiles (very simple, no auth)
- crud operations for books
    - create: title, author, year, isbn, publisher, description, tags, 
      cover image, type (book, magazine, etc.)
    - read: book "profile" page
    - update: edit book details on profile page
    - delete: remove book from catalog
    - user-based book management: read/unread, favorite, reading list, user notes 
- browse books (list, favorites, reading list)
- search and sort by title, author, year, isbn, publisher, tags
- quick stats (total books, number read, number in reading list)
- add images for book covers
  - image compressor, thumbnail generation, resizing
- import/export to/from (csv, json)
- add book to reading list
- mark book as read/unread
- mark book as favorite
- in-app settings:
  - language selection
  - user profile management (username)
  - change user
  - backup/restore database in-app button
- multilingual support (english, hungarian)
- os-native gui (primarily windows focus)
- starting with books only to limit scope but architecture needs to be flexible enough to support future catalogue-able items

Tech stack:
- Go
- SQLite
- considerations for gui:
  - fyne, wails, gio
- considerations for internationalization dictionary:
  - json (most likely), yaml, toml
